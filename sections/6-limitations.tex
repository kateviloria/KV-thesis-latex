\section{Critiques and Limitations (mostly critique, whats another name for this section)}
\label{sec:critiques}

The common and most effective approach in detecting language change still presents limitations and makes many assumptions that must be acknowledged and discussed. This section will discuss components of semantic change that are overlooked with the approach used for this thesis and its shortcomings. 

As with any task, different approaches have different aims and results. When detecting LSC through vector representations, the choice of what each vector represents can significantly change the results. For this thesis, each word in the vocabulary is represented by one vector only. However, by doing so the meaning of a word is limited, or arguably broadened. Words that have more than one sense or meaning will only be represented by an average of all of the times the words has been used in the corpora. When LSC is detected, a word’s multiple senses will be seen as one entity. For example, if both of a word’s senses such as ‘arms’ as in the body part and ‘arms’ as in weapons appear in the same corpus, it will result in having one vector representation although each sense is quite different from the other. Using this approach while also using corpora that have time period spans as wide as multiple centuries can also overlook and skew the data. \citet{shoemark-etal-2019-room} show that there is a high chance that seasonal changes in words interfere with detecting semantic chance within short time periods and present synthetic evaluation as a solution. An example of a seasonal trend would be the drastic change in frequency and use of the word turkey during Thanksgiving. It is also important to acknowledge that this approach is inherently biased towards word frequency and lead to noise being introduced within the embeddings. (\citet{dubossarsky-etal-2017-outta}, \citet{kaiser-etal-2020-ims}, \citet{schlechtweg-etal-2020-semeval}) (OUTTA CONTROL, HOW LOW CAN YOU GO, SEMEVAL)


RE-READ THIS

The method in which corpora are divided into time periods also present complexities within detecting LSC that must be considered. \citep{hengchen2021challenges} (ANNOTATION, challenges) By grouping long periods of time as one time period, the slight variation and changes of meaning words undergo are either lost or minimized. A word or sense’s change in meaning does not have one clear trajectory. As with the SemEval Task, we are essentially detecting the average change (EW) of a word within two time periods. In order to detect “smaller” semantic changes, the time periods and the size of the corpora must be reduced for this end goal (WEIRD WORD). The genres of text within the corpora being used must also be considered. The texts used for English, German, and Swedish all contain newspaper corpora from specific time periods. It is important to be mindful that this kind of corpora is representative of a specific part of culture and is composed of a specific type of writing style. These corpora used with the Distributional Hypothesis “often conflate lexical meaning with cultural and topical information available in the corpus used as a basis for the model.” (REF CHALLENGES) With such limited contexts, a question to keep in mind is whether newspaper corpora provide enough insight into the usages of a word and therefore the changes a word undergoes. \citep{hengchen2021challenges} (REF CHALLENGES) Using a mix of text genres will provide a wider variety of word usages as one word sense could be used more in one genre over the other. For Sem-Eval, this is mitigated by having annotators provide the ground truth of a limited sample of a language using the DURel framework \citep{DURel2018}(REF SCHLECT) instead of referring to a dictionary. (MISSING EXPLAINING SENTENCE?) In detecting LSC as is the case with other research areas, domain-specific tasks will require different datasets and different methods of processing data. There is no one method to achieve all the goals of language change and different types of change in meaning can be detected through different methodologies.
