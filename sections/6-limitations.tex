\section{Limitations}

The common and most effective approach in this field still presents many critiques and limitations. (TOO VAGUE) The method in which corpora are divided into time bins also present complexities within detecting LSC that must be considered \citep{hengchen2021challenges}. By grouping long periods of time as one entity/time bin/THING (??), the slight variation and changes of meaning words undergo are either lost or minimized. A word or senseâ€™s change in meaning does not have one clear trajectory. As with the SemEval Task, we are essentially detecting the average change (EW) of a word within two timeframes.
